# Meme Flight Simulator On Scratch
Hello there! This is just me and my friend's attempt at making a flight simulator on Scratch! I'm @skypixellol on scratch, and my friend is @bpa812 on scratch.
Here's the link to our first version (Please note that this is not our latest!):

Here's the link to our updated version:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/915664512

We also have SB3 files available for PERSONAL USE ONLY in our release section.
Here's the link to our releases:

Also, fun fact, you can use scratch offline by downloading it: (but our multiplayer feature won't work)
